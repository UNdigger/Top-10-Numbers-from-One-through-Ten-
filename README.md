Hey everyone, it's time for another "Top 10", and this week we're kicking it old-school, with a classic that is backkick, top 10 numbers from 1 through 10! Starting us off at number 10, it's number 7! At number 9, it's number 8! And at number 7, it's number 9, but look out 7, at number 6, it's number 4. Quick recap, because number 9 was number 8, but you'll need to know the context for this next number, because it's number 5, for number 4! And at number 4, it's number 2, but number 3 this week is also number 5! That's right folks, there are two number 5s, a number 6, and number 3. In your face number 3, you didn't even make the top 10! And at number 2, it's number 1. So close 1, but there can only be one number 1, and that one number at number 1 is number 5! Fuck you number 1 and 3, your numbers are garbage!
